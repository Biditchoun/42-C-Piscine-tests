Those are all the tests I created during my C piscine of july 2025.
It made the testing in evaluations notably faster, leaving me more time to read the code.
Most test pages can just be used by importing them in the corresponding C folder,
and running "cc -Wall Werror Wextra CXXtests.c */*.c".
The main issues you will encounter with those tests are twofold :
- Firstly, if there are functions with the same name where you are testing,
the compiler will not be happy. You will need to rename one of the identical functions and their call
(it often happened with ft_strlen, which I then renamed ftstrlen, for example).
- Secondly, undone exercices will need their corresponding tests to be deactivated in the tests page.
You can do that simply by putting /* and */ from the first undone exercice to the end.
Do not forget the ending bracket though !

I do test if functions are protected against NULL pointers when necessary.
However, the moulinette does not.
As such, you can change the variable "null" to anything else than 'y' if you want to ignore those tests.

Almost always, those tests will print the expected result on a line,
and the gotten result with the provided function on the line below.
I will include a copy/paste of what is expected in the README of each test page.
There are other specificities that might be indicated those READMEs.
I think that's it, happy coding and learning what I did here :D
